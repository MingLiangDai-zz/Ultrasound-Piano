# Ultrasound-Piano
**Description:** 
This is an Arduino project that uses the ultrasound sensor and the passive buzzer to generate a piano that can play over 60 musical notes. It takes advantage of the ultrasound sensorâ€™s capability of accurately measuring the distance of an object placed in front of it and using a simple mathematical expression, the distance is converted to a sound frequency that the passive buzzer is able to play.

**Instruction:** Connect the electrical components according to the diagram provided.
